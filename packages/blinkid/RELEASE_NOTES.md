## v7.6.4

### Improvements

- Fixed `feedbackUiOptions` being reassigned to an empty object and ignoring passed configuration
- **Worker proxy**: Use `createProxyWorker<BlinkIdWorkerProxy>` from `@microblink/core-common` instead of local `createProxyWorker`. Optimize worker frame processing by auto-transferring ImageData buffers in the proxy worker layer, reducing per-frame copy overhead and GC pressure. After process(...), the original ImageData.data.buffer is intentionally detached.
- **core-common integration**: Depend on and re-export shared utilities from `@microblink/core-common` instead of in-package implementations: `createProxyWorker`, `getUserId`, `createCustomImageData`, `getCrossOriginWorkerURL`, `shouldUseLightweightBuild`, and `deviceInfo` (including derived device info, navigator types, and related helpers). Removed local implementations and their tests; `getUserId` is now called with a storage key (`getUserId(STORAGE_KEY)`). Prepare-publish updated to exclude `@microblink/core-common` from published package.json. README and repository URLs updated (Developer Hub, microblink/web-sdks).

## v7.6.3

### Improvements

- Improved automatic lightweight build detection for mobile devices
    - Now uses Device Memory API to detect low-memory devices (< 4GB)
    - Applies to all mobile devices (phones and tablets) with available memory information
    - Falls back to `undefined` when memory information is unavailable, allowing manual configuration
    - Previously used a simple user agent check for all mobile devices
- Updated the camera picking logic
- Improved error handling on the `Camera` class

## 7.6.2

### Bugfixes

- Fixes `microblinkProxyUrl` handling
    - Prevent an extra ping to the Microblink server when a proxy URL is configured (previously one redundant request was sent).
    - Preserve the user-provided path when using a proxy URL (previously the path was removed).

## 7.6.1

### What's New

- For some documents, the document type was returned as `none`, which was causing confusion. To prevent this, we are filling in the document type from the barcode in case customers are using `barcode-id` mode.
- The fix is applied to all the AAMVA types, plus some others (Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, SouthAfrica).

## v7.6.0

### What's New

- We introduced event tracking across the SDK lifecycle, giving you deeper insights into user journeys, success rates, and drop-off points during scanning sessions. These enhanced analytics make it easier to identify optimization opportunities and ensure the best possible user experience.
- Updated detection analysis logic in case of photo mode
- Added support for capturing the back of US passports that feature a barcode
- Unparsable barcodes no longer prevent the scanning process from finishing and will be returned as raw data in the result if the `recognitionModeFilter` is set to `enableFullDocumentRecognition`. Using `enableBarcodeId` still requires the barcode to be parsable in order to successfully finish the scanning process
- Added a new `parsed` property on the barcode property of the `SingleSideScanningResult` which indicates if the raw barcode data was successfully parsed into structured information.
- Improved visual clarity and of feedback UI elements
- Added a new UI state `MOVE_LAST_PAGE` for Indian passports and applicable US passports, as well as the accompanying UI feedback message in `@microblink/blinkid-ux-manager`.
- Renamed `#handleUiStateChanges` method to `#updateUiStateFromProcessResult`
- Added missing `showHelpTooltipTimeout` option to the `FeedbackUiOptions`
- Added haptic feedback on supported devices
- Added translation files in `@microblink/camera-manager` and `@microblink/blinkid-ux-manager` for 33 new languages

### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue with scanning the back of the Essad Card which was causing only Date of Expiry to be extracted
- Fixed the issue with `additionalNameInformation` extraction for France ID and Residence Permit
- Prevent parsing of two-line MRZ in TD1 format unless it's explicitly allowed. This will prevent false positive MRZ extraction on documents where the last line of the MRZ is covered or not fully visible
- Users are no longer forced to scan back sides of Alien and Refugee passports
- Fixed the issue with Togo ID where document number from VIZ was overriden by a wrong value from MRZ

## v7.0.1

### Fixes

- Fixed issues with remote license handling

## v7.0.0

We're excited to introduce BlinkID v7, a major upgrade designed to simplify your integration and deliver a simpler ID scanning experience. With BlinkID v7, we're taking a fresh approach to scanning logic by introducing a more straightforward, session-based API for an easier configuration path, all while boosting first-time scan success rate.

### Highlights & Integration Improvements

- **Unified session-based API**: We've moved away from juggling multiple recognizers (e.g., SingleSide, MultiSide) to a single session-based approach, unifying scanning logic under one simplified API. There's no need to switch recognizers anymore.
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing production keys will continue to work with v7.0. No new license key is required for the upgrade.
- **More maintainable codebase**: This new architecture sets the stage for easier and faster updates.

### Architecture Changes

- **New core components**: Instead of Recognizer-based architecture, BlinkID uses a streamlined session-based approach.
- **Modern TypeScript**: Written with modern TypeScript features for improved developer experience.
- **Component-based UI**: Simplified, customizable UI components for easier integration.
- **Simplified flow**: More straightforward API with clearer separation of concerns.

### Major API Changes

- **New session-based API**
  - Replaces the recognizer-based approach with a single, streamlined session model for easier scanning logic and better maintainability.

- **Modular SDK structure**
  - The SDK is now modular:
    - [`@microblink/blinkid-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microblink/blinkid-core) for scanning logic.
    - [`@microblink/blinkid-ux-manager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microblink/blinkid-ux-manager) for prebuilt UI components.
    - [`@microblink/camera-manager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microblink/camera-manager) for camera stream handling.
    - [`@microblink/blinkid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microblink/blinkid) as the all-in-one package.

- **Simplified initialization & result handling**
  - New SDK initialization method:

    ```javascript
    import { createBlinkId } from "@microblink/blinkid";

    const blinkid = await createBlinkId({
      licenseKey: "your-license-key",
    });
    ```

  - Results are now retrieved through structured session-based callbacks.

- **Enhanced UI customization**
  - UI settings enable direct customization of typography, colors, and strings.
  - The modular architecture allows advanced modifications for branding and accessibility.

- **Renamed settings for improved clarity**
  - `blurStrictnessLevel` → `blurDetectionLevel`
  - `enableBlurFilter` → `skipFramesWithBlur`
  - `glareStrictnessLevel` → `glareDetectionLevel`
  - `enableGlareFilter` → `skipFramesWithGlare`
  - `combineFrameResults` → `enableMultiFrameExtraction`
  - `cardRotation`→ `documentRotation`
  - And more...

### Plan Your Upgrade

Note that v6 is now considered legacy. Comprehensive documentation is in development - in the meantime, please refer to our example applications in the repository under `apps/examples` for integration patterns:

- **[blinkid-simple](https://github.com/microblink/web-sdks/tree/main/apps/examples/blinkid-simple/)**: Minimal integration with default UI
- **[blinkid-core-api](https://github.com/microblink/web-sdks/tree/main/apps/examples/blinkid-core-api/)**: Low-level usage of the core API
- **[blinkid-advanced-setup](https://github.com/microblink/web-sdks/tree/main/apps/examples/blinkid-advanced-setup/)**: Custom UI and advanced configuration
- **[blinkid-preload](https://github.com/microblink/web-sdks/tree/main/apps/examples/blinkid-preload/)**: Preloading resources for faster startup

For any questions or feedback, reach out to support@microblink.com. We value your input and look forward to hearing how BlinkID v7 improves your app's experience!
