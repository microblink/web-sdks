# @microblink/blinkid-wasm

## 7.6.4

### Patch Changes

- Shared types moved to `@microblink/wasm-common`.
- `createBlinkIdScanningSession` renamed to `createScanningSession`.

## 7.6.3

### Patch Changes

- Update version

## 7.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Bump version

## 7.6.1

### Patch Changes

- For some documents, the document type was returned as `none`, which was causing confusion. To prevent this, we are filling in the document type from the barcode in case customers are using `barcode-id` mode. The fix is applied to all the AAMVA types, plus some others (Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, SouthAfrica).
- Added `sub-field-designator` value to `BarcodeElementKey` type

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for ping v3
- Added support for capturing the back of US passports that feature a barcode
- Unparsable barcodes no longer prevent the scanning process from finishing and will be returned as raw data in the result if the `recognitionModeFilter` is set to `enableFullDocumentRecognition`. Using `enableBarcodeId` still requires the barcode to be parsable in order to successfully finish the scanning process
- Added a new `parsed` property on the barcode property of the `SingleSideScanningResult` which indicates if the raw barcode data was successfully parsed into structured information.
- Prevent parsing of two-line MRZ in TD1 format unless it's explicitly allowed. This will prevent false positive MRZ extraction on documents where the last line of the MRZ is covered or not fully visible
- Users are no longer forced to scan back sides of Alien and Refugee passports
- Fixed the issue with Togo ID where document number from VIZ was overriden by a wrong value from MRZ

  - `MrzResult` now correctly populates the `opt1` and `opt2` fields.
  - Corrected casing in `MrzResult`: `primaryId` and `secondaryId` are no longer incorrectly mapped as `primaryID` and `secondaryID`.
  - Fixed an issue where the `lowerLeft` property in `BlinkIdProcessResult` had a trailing space in its name.
  - Fixed and clarified the type specification for `MrzResult.dateOfBirth` and `MrzResult.dateOfExpiry`: although the runtime values already matched the `DateResult<string>` type, the declaration was previously set to `Date`.
